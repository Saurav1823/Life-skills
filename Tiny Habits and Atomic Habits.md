## Question 1: Most Interesting Idea (Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg)

The most interesting idea for me was that we should start very small when building a habit. Even doing something very tiny, can grow into a big habit over time.


## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.

- **M (Motivation)** – The desire to do something  
- **A (Ability)** – How easy the task is  
- **P (Prompt)** – The reminder to do the task

To make a new habit easier, we should focus on making it very simple


## Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate?

Celebrating after completing a habit creates positive emotions in the brain. When we feel good after doing something, our brain wants to repeat it.


## Question 4: Most Interesting Idea

The most interesting idea was that small improvement every day can create big results in the long term. Improving just 1% daily can completely change your life over time.


## Question 5: Book's Perspective About Identity 

The book says habits are connected to identity. Instead of saying "I want to run," we should say "I am becoming a runner." Real change happens when we change how we see ourselves.


## Question 6: How to Make a Habit Easier to Do?

The book suggests:

- Make the habit 
- Reduce the steps needed to start  
- Prepare everything in advance  
- Start with very small actions  
- Follow the two-minute rule  

Making habits easy increases the chance of doing them daily.


## Question 7: How to Make a Habit Harder to Do?

To break a bad habit:

- Remove the tasks which triggers 
- Increase difficulty to do the habit
- Make it less attractive  
- Think of consequences  

When something becomes difficult or uncomfortable, we are less likely to repeat it.
