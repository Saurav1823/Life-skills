## 2. Reflective Listening

### Question 2  
According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

Reflective listening focuses on understanding, verifying, and clarifying the speaker’s message. The key points are:

1. Carefully listen to the message without assumptions.
2. Reflect or repeat the main idea in your own words.
3. Identify and acknowledge the speaker’s emotions.
4. Ask for confirmation to ensure the message is correct.
5. Avoid judging or giving immediate advice.
6. Make sure both parties agree on the discussed points.

In business or software projects, reflective listening means taking proper notes during meetings, sharing them with stakeholders, and confirming that everyone agrees. This avoids misunderstandings and ensures the team is aligned.

## 4. Types of Communication

### Question 5  
When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

I switch to a passive communication style when I want to avoid conflict, especially with seniors or authority figures. Sometimes I stay silent even if I disagree because I do not want arguments.

### Question 6  
When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

I may become aggressive when I feel stressed, frustrated, or when I believe someone is not listening to me. In such situations, my tone may become harsh without realizing it.

### Question 7  
When do you switch into Passive Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

Passive aggressive behavior may appear when I feel upset but do not express it directly. For example, using sarcasm, giving short replies, or avoiding direct communication instead of discussing the issue openly.

To make communication assertive, I can:

1. Express my thoughts clearly and confidently.
2. Use "I" statements instead of blaming others.
3. Maintain calm body language and steady tone.
4. Respect other people's opinions while sharing my own.
5. Set clear boundaries without being rude.
6. Listen actively before responding.
